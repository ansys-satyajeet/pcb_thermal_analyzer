# PCB Thermal Analyzer

PCB Thermal Analyzer is a PyAEDT based web-app to simulate PCB thermal response. The app uses Ansys Icepak to read in a ECAD file and IDF file and assign boundary conditions based on a modified boundary conditions file extracted from the IDF file. 

Download the files on to a desired directory on your computer. Navigate to the directory using a terminal or a command prompt 
and type the following the command:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In the directory containing the files and folder, type the following command in the command prompt:

```python
python pcb_thermal_analyzer.py
```
